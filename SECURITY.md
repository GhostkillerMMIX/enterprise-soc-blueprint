# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the Enterprise SOC Implementation:

| Version | Supported          |

| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Enterprise SOC Implementation team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### Where to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **Security Team**: security@enterprise-soc.com
- **Lead Maintainer**: maintainer@enterprise-soc.com

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
3. **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: We will send you regular updates about our progress
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access a system beyond what is necessary to demonstrate a vulnerability
- Report vulnerabilities as soon as possible after discovery

## Security Considerations for Deployment

### Infrastructure Security
- **Network Isolation**: Deploy in private subnets with proper security groups
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption at rest and in transit for all components
- **Access Control**: Implement least-privilege access with MFA
- **Monitoring**: Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Updates**: Keep all components updated with latest security patches

### Splunk Security
- **Authentication**: Configure strong authentication (LDAP/SAML preferred)
- **SSL/TLS**: Enable SSL for all Splunk communications
- **User Roles**: Implement role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data and configure appropriate retention

### SOAR Security
- **API Security**: Secure all SOAR API endpoints with authentication
- **Playbook Security**: Review all playbooks for potential security issues
- **Credential Management**: Use secure credential storage (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- **Network Access**: Restrict SOAR platform network access

### Cloud Security
- **IAM Policies**: Follow least-privilege principles for all IAM roles
- **Resource Tagging**: Tag all resources for proper governance
- **Backup Security**: Encrypt and secure all backups
- **Compliance**: Ensure deployment meets your compliance requirements

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
- **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
- **Testing**: Include security tests for new features

### For Users
- **Environment Isolation**: Use separate environments for dev/staging/production
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the SOC implementation updated
- **Security Monitoring**: Monitor the SOC infrastructure itself
- **Incident Response**: Have a plan for security incidents in the SOC

## Security Contact

For general security questions or concerns about this project:
- **Email**: security@enterprise-soc.com
- **PGP Key**: [Link to PGP key if available]
